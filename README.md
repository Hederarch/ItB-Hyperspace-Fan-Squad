 *A fanmade mod for Into the Breach, featuring the jets from Sleeper Games' Hyperspace Anthology.*
 
 Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official Into the Breach discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW
 
(also this does require Into the Breach Advanced Edition and the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)

## What's Included
This mod adds the leading jets from each of Sleeper Games' hit titles as playable Mechs.

![The Paw](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/699323570211520556/1029253805956669490/paw_demo.gif)
**The Paw** from *Hyperpace Dogfights* comes with the GC Chaingun, a simple but versatile weapon.

**Puppy Renegade** from *-Red-Tether->* has the Contemper Harpoon, a brutal long-range hook that pulls you *through* your opponents.

and the ship from *Swirl W@tch* comes with the Chaff Launcher, a large smoke bomb that works great for crowd control.

and as an added bonus, this squad also comes with a brand new mech palette based on the bright sunset tones of Hyperspace Dogfights, **Hyper Hot Neon**!
